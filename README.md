## Comparrison Between Standard DH and Modified DH Parameters in Recursive Newton-Euler Algorithm 
## Robotics II Couse Project

The project purpose is to analyze the CPU-time required by the two algorithms for compute the joint torques having the desired joint positions and velocities. We defined a set of exciting trajectories using the CAD software V-REP (Coppelia-Robotics), which have been executed by the robot. The collected data from the laboratory activities are the inputs for estimation of dynamics coefficient of the robot (the producer did not publish them).
